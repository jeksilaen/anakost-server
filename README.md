## Usage :wrench:

> ### __Adding / Subtracting Expenses__
This is the main functionality. By pressing either the plus or the minus button, you can add a new expenses!

> ### __Manage Sources__
Each expenses may have different sources. On the top right of the screen, you can manage and add new sources.
